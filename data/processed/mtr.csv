It is located on Che Kung Miu Road, Sha Tin. Its position was Sha Tin Tau Temporary Housing Area, so it was originally named as ""Sha Tin Tau Station"" before the Ma On Shan Line operated. It is located near the Che Kung Miu temple. On the third day of the first month in the Chinese calendar (also known as the third day of the Lunar New Year) many people use the station to get to the temple. The station is always crowded during those days.<br><br><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/ANkjSgEwZh6HcYVMrfvFKPy6aZ2sxQADyVOandEU9HlboK0ziqmKNlQOQVFnTURCA1YBAzke9lYe9-CtTMpl7cDcBaG40BTp4wCTzSN-wJaHDFqoqXP4FFMdOjU8Vgdibr059Ill616Y6c7OtoUFEEK9gpqszknEdEakuxFwAI9Z1abvGgMuLz4OUH76WDj6niBRTg"" height=""200"" width=""auto"" />",114.186262,22.375049,0.0
